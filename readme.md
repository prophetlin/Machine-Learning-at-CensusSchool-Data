# Project Stage 2-CensusSchool

Perform some data analyis using python code, and building predictive models and were built using 3 separate supervised machine learning techniques:

1. Multiple Linear Regression

2. K Nearest Neighbours

3. Neural networks

And use above machine learning techniques investigates the correlation in a plethora of question on students' surveys across three different countries.
